It looks like there are 2 possibilities to use the Json file.

1. Do it frame by frame and asign everything from one general manager
2. Have each character controll itself by giving all of one player data to it at the beginning.


Pros for 1.
Can replace the replay file with other replay files easily
The score and time would be easy with this system
Everything for every frame will be available in one place. (can also be a con at the same time)
## If you want to add a playback system, it would be easier to do it this way (one of my plans)

Cons for 1
Harder to do interpolation (if needed, like when missing frames or framerate is not enough)


Pros for 2
Less logic for the general manager script
Easier interpolation for missing keyframes etc, because it can work towards the next keyframe, and not care about the rest

Cons for 2
Requires a scan trough all data at the beginning
